My game is called Lorbnak; the Star Destroyer.  It's set in the year 2259, after the destruction of earth.  

In 2214, Lorbnak visited the planet earth, where he discovered dance music.  Lorbnak was so enthralled with the dance music that he vowed to travel around the universe, blasting the lovely music out of his spaceship as he flew.  The only thing Lorbnak needed to keep his spaceship afloat was star dust which was convenient at the time because the universe was full of it!  45 years later, Lorbnak is still flying, but the universe is running out of stardust.  Can you help him avoid asteroids, collect star dust, and share the glory of dance music with the universe!?!?!?!?!
